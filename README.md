# GrimmBox
## What
For now, it's just me futzing about with termbox

## Why
I really like terminal user interfaces so I figured I should learn me some,
possibly with a view to doing something useful with them in the future.

## How
    git clone git@github.com:oholiab/grimmbox
    cd grimmbox
    export GOPATH=$(pwd)
    make

Should grab all dependencies, build and run. It doesn't do anything impressive
yet.

## Why aren't you just using termui?
Because in this case form is more important to function and I wanted some
window borders to be orange, and termui (whilst fantastic) doesn't expose that
for you.
